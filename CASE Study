Challenge 1 - Case Study 

## Overview and Origin ##

Blockstream, incorporated in 2014 by Adam Back, Erik Svenson and Pieter Wuille (and unspecified other parties) is a financial technology infrastructure provider that utilizes bitcoin blockchain. 

The justification for forming the business came from the founders' shared opinions regarding Bitcoin's successful qualities and ideas to challenge its slow adoption. The team believed that if technology is created to enable new cryptocurrency networks without actually creationg new cryptocurrencies, the market would respond favourably due to this approach limiting fragmentation.

To date, Blockstream has received $424 million in funding. Blockstream has 43 institutional investors and two angel investors. Blockstream is not a public company. It's valuation is $3.2 billion.

## Business Activities

Blockstream can be perceived as a one-stop-shop provider of enterprise level blockchain infrastructure. They solve the problem of adoption by providing all the solutions, including satellite connection to bitcoin, scalable blockchain networks, bitcoin mining hosts, and bitcoin assurance of digital asset issuance. 

There is little reporting on Blockstream's customers. However, according to a Coindesk article, Fidelity Center for Applied Technology and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman are customers of Blockstream's Bitcoin Mining Farm. Based on this information, one can make the assumption that Blockstream is targetting high net worth individuals with an existing interest in Bitcoin as well as financial institutions that have shown interest in adopting blockchain technologies.

The main technology Blockstream uses is Bitcoin. For it's "Blockstream Satellite" solution, Blockstream utilizes open source Software Defrined Radio (SDR) technologies.  


## Landscape

Blockstream is in multiple financial industry domains, including payments, networks, and trading. 

Within these domains, paymens specifically, there have been a number of growing trends including digital wallets, embedded payments, increases in usage of digital currencies, and in general more sophisiticated customer journeys. 

Major competitors in this space include Orbs, Lightning Labs, Horizen Labs, Boba, Calimero, Horizen, DigitalBits, Loom Network, Antimatter, Ark and more.


## Results

Blockstream is one of the largest competitors in its space. More recenlty it spent $5 million on bitcoin mining hardware, signalling a big bet on Bitcoin rebounding after its recent low this year. In August 2021, Blockstream reached unicorn status with a valuation of $3.2 billion.

Blockstream is invested heavily in R&D which may lead to improvements in zero-emission Bitcoin mining. To the effect of it's R&D efforts, in February 2023, Blockstream announced its new brand Blockstream Research Brand.

Relative to its competitors, Blockstream has one of the largest valuations and some of the largest partnerships, including Tesla.

## Recommendations



Based on Blockstream's current product and service offerings, I would advise Blockstream to provide the same service offerings for Ethereum, in addition to Bitcoin. 

Betting everything on one cryptocurrency can be perceived as a key risk. The goal is not to adopt several cryptocurrencies at once, but to diversify its supported cryptocurrencies at a cautious and calculated rate.
